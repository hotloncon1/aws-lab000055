#### Expose the **/tripsfromcity** RESTful API endpoint

The first path we exposed was quite simple - **/trips** gets all the trips in the system. But we know our source code implementation allows us to specify a filter to query for trips that originate from a particular city or have a particular destination, so we want to expose this functionality to our API consumers. First, we will expose the **/tripsfromcity** path.

18. In the **Resources** section, click **/**
* Click **Actions**
* Click **Create Resource**
![Create And Expose the API with Amazon API Gateway](/images/3-create-single-page-app/3.3-create-api-with-api-gateway/create-api-with-api-gateway-018.png?featherlight=false&width=90pc)
19. In the **Resource Name** section, type ```tripsfromcity```

20. Our call into the Lambda function requires a city parameter. We will follow the standard pattern for RESTful interfaces, and pass this parameter in as a URL parameter. Select **/tripsfromcity**
* Click **Actions**
* Click **Create Resource**
![Create And Expose the API with Amazon API Gateway](/images/3-create-single-page-app/3.3-create-api-with-api-gateway/create-api-with-api-gateway-020.png?featherlight=false&width=90pc)
21. In the **Resource Name** section, type ```{city}```
* In the **Resource Path** section, delete the default and replace with ```{city}```
* Click **Create Resource**

25. Click **OK**
![Create And Expose the API with Amazon API Gateway](/images/3-create-single-page-app/3.3-create-api-with-api-gateway/create-api-with-api-gateway-025.png?featherlight=false&width=90pc)
26. When the method is created, you will see the **Method Execution** panel. as before for the /trips resource. We can’t go ahead and test the API call just yet, because we need to transform the request through API Gateway so that the city parameter is passed through to the Lambda function correctly.

The **devlounge.lambda.FindTripsFromCityHandler** handler expects to see the input data in this JSON format:
```
{
	"payload" : 
	{
        "city": "Melbourne"
    }
}
```
{{% notice note %}} 
This would cause the Lambda function to search DynamoDB for all trips that originate from Melbourne. We need to add a **Body Mapping Template** for this method in API Gateway to correctly transform the request into this format.

28. Scroll further down to show the mapping template entry text field. Paste in the following template:
```
{
    "payload" : {
        "city": "$input.params('city')"
    }
}
```
{{% notice info %}} 
This template will take the parameter **{city}** from the URL and add it into a JSON payload that is sent to the Lambda function, as a property of the payload object, just as the Lambda function expects.

{{% notice note %}} 
The schema defined here for this Lambda function is completely arbitrary, and in your own application you could use a completely different model. The mapping template gives you the flexibility to transform the inbound data on-the-fly through the API Gateway endpoint.

29. Click **Method Execution**
![Create And Expose the API with Amazon API Gateway](/images/3-create-single-page-app/3.3-create-api-with-api-gateway/create-api-with-api-gateway-029.png?featherlight=false&width=90pc)

32. API Gateway will make the call into the Lambda function, passing the value Melbourne into the Body Mapping Template you have defined, which will insert the search parameter Melbourne into the JSON payload that is sent to the Lambda function. This will cause the function handler to consume the JSON and execute a search in the DynamoDB table, and return the results. You will see a result similar to this:

NIf the data looks right, and there are no errors, you are ready to move on to the next exercise.

#### Use CloudFormation/SAM via the AWS CLI to deploy the HotelSearch microservice

In the previous steps, you manually deployed and configured the **TripSearch** microservice, including the Lambda functions and API Gateway resources. You will have noticed that there are quite a few steps required, and doing this manually is time consuming and prone to errors. In this step, you will use the AWS CLI and CloudFormation/SAM to deploy the **HotelSearch** microservice, instead of manually deploying the resources.

By using CloudFormation/SAM, many of the manual steps will be taken care of for you, streamlining the deployment process. You will still have to manually trigger the process, but the actual deployment will be automated.

The **HotelSpecials** microservice needs to access a MySQL database to retrieve the hotel specials data. The lab environment has automatically deployed and seeded a database for you, and the connection details are provided in Cloudformation Outputs tab with instructions below on where to update the placeholder in the template you will use to deploy the microservice. The MySQL instance has been deployed using Amazon RDS and is not publicly-accessible since it is launched in a private subnet. Therefore, for the Lambda function to be able to connect to the database, the Lambda function will also need to be deployed into a private subnet by enabling VPC Integration. The template.yml file provided has all the required setup to do this, you just need to update the placeholders as per the below instructions.

72. In the **Command Prompt**, execute the following command to package the Lambda function
```
aws cloudformation package --template template.yml --s3-bucket <S3BucketLambdaCodeBucketName> --output-template template-export.yml
```

The command will upload the build artefact to the S3 bucket, and then update the **template.yml** pointer to the code artefact on S3, and write out a new template with this update included, to a file called **template-export.yml**\
It will take a moment or two for the upload of the artefact to complete.

73. Execute the following command to create and deploy a **CloudFormation Change Set**
```
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file template-export.yml --stack-name HotelSpecialsAPI --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

74. Go to [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
* Click **Stack**.
* You will see the **HotelSpecialsAPI** stack. This indicates that the CloudFormation Change Set has been created. The command you issued will create the Change Set and then automatically execute the Change Set. It will take a few moments to complete the execution

75. Select **HotelSpecialsAPI** stack, click tab **Events** and eview the steps that the CloudFormation template has applied to your environment. These will match the resources and actions in the **template-output.yml** file.
76. Go to [**AWS API Gateway console**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home)
* Click **iDevelop - Hotel Specials API**

78. The **Integration Request** panel will be shown. **Lambda Function** specified:

The specified value is not a Lambda function, but instead, is a **Stage Variable** that will be replaced at runtime by API Gateway. Therefore, in order for this API call to succeed, the **Stage** in API Gateway must have defined a value for the **envHotelSpecials** stage variable.

79. Click **Stages**
* Click **prod**
* Click tab **Stage Variables**
![Create And Expose the API with Amazon API Gateway](/images/3-create-single-page-app/3.3-create-api-with-api-gateway/create-api-with-api-gateway-076.png?featherlight=false&width=90pc)
{{% notice info %}} 
a single variable is defined - **envHotelSpecials** - which correlates to the stage variable name the GET method was expecting. The value of the variable is **GetHotelSpecials** which is the name of the Lambda function that the template created using the JAR file you built and uploaded during the package/deploy process.

81. After a moment while the Lambda function is initialised, you should see the JSON result of querying the mySQL database from the Lambda function

If you see a JSON payload with no errors, you have successfully deployed an API and supporting Lambda function that queries the mySQL database. Notice how much quicker and easier that was to deploy without any manual intervention? That is the power of automation. In the next exercise, we will take this one step further, using the (now familiar) CI/CD pipeline approach to deploy our next API.
