#### Overview

In this exercise you will create the Single Page Application (SPA) website for TravelBuddy. A single-page application is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages. The SPA will interact with a set of APIs exposed by API Gateway.
