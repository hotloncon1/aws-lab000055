# Creating an Authenticated Single Page Application (SPA) 

#### Oveview

In this lab we will iterate on our TravelBuddy monolithic implementation, and move it to a serverless/serviceful architecture, with microservices. In previous Labs, we have looked at various serverless concepts - for example, AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway - but in this lab, we will rethink our monolith, move to a completely serverless model and incorporate authentication and authorisation using Amazon Cognito.

You will take various approaches when deploying the Lambda functions that make up the microservices, from manual deployment to automated CI/CD deployment, to ensure you have a good understanding of each of parts of the architecture, and how infrastructure automation simplifies and streamlines deployment.
